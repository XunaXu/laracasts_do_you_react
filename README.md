How to start:

Run 'npm install' then 'npm start' in terminal at the root folder level. (a simple http-server is used)

Notes: 

* for 8 and 9 episodes, 'npm install' is needed to run first at its own folder level.

* liveload is no longer available for sublime text 3. For 9.refs episode, gulp and browser-sync are used. run 'gulp serve' in terminal at the '9.refs' folder level, this will acchive the same purpose.


Extra:

I ran through the 'Do you react?' tutorial in laracasts by JeffreyWay which was broadcasted in April 2015. It seems they are not providing source code .. ????? anyway, who would go through everything as I did.. oh well.. lots of rewinding videos though = =. Hope this may save some people's time.
